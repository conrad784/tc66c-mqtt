# ToDo

- Refine the custom AppArmor-policy (see
  [`ðŸ“„ docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md#using-d-bus))
- Add a device identifier to the `tc66c/` MQTT topic; this allows measurements
  for multiple devices to be handled
- Upgrade to Node.js 14 (require it in `ðŸ“„ package.json` and update the Docker
  container)
- Add support for additional architectures (`armhf` / `amd64`) to the Docker
  container
- Properly manage failures; right now we gracefully shutdown the container
  (regardless of the script's exit code)
  - Build some retry logic into the s6-overlay scripts? Or find a way to
    "escalate" the problem out of the container?
