# ToDo

- [ ] Refine the custom AppArmor-policy (see
      [`📄 docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md#using-d-bus))
- [ ] Upgrade to Node.js 14 (require it in `📄 package.json` and update the
      Docker container)
- [ ] Add support for additional architectures (`armhf` / `amd64`) to the Docker
      container
- [ ] Properly manage failures; right now we gracefully shutdown the container
      (regardless of the script's exit code)
  - Build some retry logic into the s6-overlay scripts? Or find a way to
    "escalate" the problem out of the container?
- [ ] The multi-arch Dockers don't actually work... 😳
  - The `📄 Dockerfile` is hardcoded to using `arm64v8/node:12-alpine3.12` as
    its base image _and_ I'm pulling in the `s6-overlay-aarch64-installer`
    regardless of the target architecture... 🤐
